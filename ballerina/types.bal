# An *event* is an object representing a change to a resource that was

# The event may be triggered by a different `user` than the
# subscriber. For example, if user A subscribes to a task and user B
# modified it, the event’s user will be user B. Note: Some events
# are generated by the system, and will have `null` as the user. API
# consumers should make sure to handle this case.
# 
# The `resource` that triggered the event may be different from the one
# that the events were requested for or the webhook is subscribed to. For
# example, a subscription to a project will contain events for tasks
# contained within the project.
# 
# **Note:** pay close attention to the relationship between the fields
# `Event.action` and `Event.change.action`.
# `Event.action` represents the action taken on the resource
# itself, and `Event.change.action` represents how the information
# within the resource's fields have been modified.

# * When at task is added to a project, `Event.action` will be
# `added`, `Event.parent` will be an object with the `id` and
# `type` of the project, and there will be no `change` field.

# * When an assignee is set on the task, `Event.parent` will be
# `null`, `Event.action` will be `changed`,
# `Event.change.action` will be `changed`, and `new_value` will
# be an object with the user's `id` and `type`.
# 
# 
# * When a collaborator is added to the task, `Event.parent` will
